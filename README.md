# WTWR (What to Wear?)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.
